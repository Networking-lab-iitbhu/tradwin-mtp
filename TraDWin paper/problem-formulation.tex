\section{\textbf{Problem Formulation}}\label{sec:problem-for}

A road network can be considered an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ represents nodes, which is a collection of $N$ detector nodes, i.e., $V=\{v_1,v_2,...,v_n\}$ where $N = |V|$ and $v_i$ is the $i$th detector node. $E$ represents the $N_E = |E|$ road links connecting the detectors, and let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ denote the adjacency matrix of $G$, i.e., $A = \{e_{ij}\}, i,j=1$ to $N$ where $e_{ij} = 1$ if nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent and $0$ otherwise.

Let each node of graph $G$ at time $t$ be represented by a $D$-dimensional feature vector represented as $\mathbf{x}_i^t \in \mathbb{R}^D$ that represents the node embeddings, which consists of graph embeddings of that node in the road network, other related exogenous variables related to that node like weather, and the traffic volume at that node. Also, let the volume of traffic at time $t$ at node $i$ be $c_i^t$.

Define feature vectors for all nodes at a particular time $t$ as
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{X}_t = (\mathbf{x}_1^t, \mathbf{x}_2^t, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N^t) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
Let the number of timesteps denoted by $T$ be a hyperparameter denoting the number of consecutive time steps under consideration. Then denote the values of all feature vectors over all nodes over $T$ consecutive time intervals starting at some time $t_0$ as
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\chi} = (\mathbf{X}_{t_0}, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+1}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+T-1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N \times D} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

Given the aforementioned notation, the problem that we are tackling in this paper can be formally defined as proposing a Traffic Digital Twin (TDT) that can perform the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item \textbf{Traffic prediction:} Given graph $G(V, E)$ and a sequence $\bm{\chi}$ of feature vectors of observed historical traffic flow over $T$ consecutive intervals, i.e., $\bm{\chi} = (\mathbf{X}_{t_0}, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+1}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+T-1})$, predict $\mathbf{Y}$, the traffic volume counts $c_i$ for $i \in N$ at the next timestep $t_0+T$, i.e., $\mathbf{Y} = \{c_1^{t_0+T}, c_2^{t_0+T}, \ldots, c_N^{t_0+T}\}$. Henceforth, we refer to this task as task (i).
    \item \textbf{Imputation:} Given graph $G(V, E)$ and a sequence $\bm{\chi}$ of feature vectors of observed historical traffic flow over $T$ consecutive intervals, i.e., $\bm{\chi} = (\mathbf{X}_{t_0}, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+1}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{t_0+T-1})$, a binary mask vector $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times T}$ such that $\mathbf{M} = \{m_{ij}\}$ where $m_{ij} = 1$ if the traffic volume count at detector $i$ at time $t$ i.e. $c_{ij}$ is known and 0 otherwise to indicate its missing, impute the missing $c_{ij}$ values. Henceforth, we refer to this task as task (ii).
    \item \textbf{Traffic assignment on edge addition/removal:} Given original graph $G(V,E)$ and the new modified graph $G'(V', E')$ with an edge $e$ added or removed. Let $\phi$ be a hyperparameter denoting the number of closest neighbor nodes to the changed edge to mask out, i.e., $\mathbf{M} = \{m_i\}$ where $m_i = 1$ if the $\text{dist}(v_i,e)> \phi$ and 0 otherwise. Predict $\mathbf{Y'} = \{c'_1, c'_2, \ldots, c'_N \}$ where $c'_i$ is the traffic volume of the detectors with the modified topology $G'$ at the same timestep. Henceforth, we refer to this task as task (iii).
